## Loading the dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Decription of the variables

Used View() to look at the dataset.

There are 15 variables in this dataset.

Variables in the dataset are `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`,
`temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`,
`precip`, `pressure`, `visib`, and `time_hour`.

The important variables:

`temp` = The temperature in Fahrenheit

`humid` = The relative humidity

`time_hour` = Date and Hour when each observation was recorded

## Size of the dataset

``` r
num_rows <- nrow(early_january_weather)

num_cols <- ncol(early_january_weather)
```

The number of rows is 358 and the number of columns is 15 in the
dataset.

## The mean temperature

``` r
mean_temp <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
```

The mean temp is 39.58.

## Scatterplot of `temp` v/s `time_hour`

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, 
           y = temp, 
          color = humid)) +
          geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time in Early January",
    x = "Time (hour)",
    y = "Temperature (F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  )
```

The temperature fluctuates during the day and night. We see that
humidity increases around mid January.
